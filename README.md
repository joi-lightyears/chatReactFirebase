This chat first allow user chat to each other by connecting users, click on the search bar and type your friend's username, then click on it to connect, the chat on the right will appear allow you to chat to that person.
But the most interesting part is that you can change language will appear on that chat, if you choose Vietnamese, all incoming message will be in Vietnamese and on that end user will receive your message in Vietnamese but if that person have different language set like English, your message will be translated from Vietnamese to English. Pretty cool right.
